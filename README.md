# Derivatives Modelling in Python

Largely adapted from Justin London's Modelling Derivatives in C++ (2005). 

This project covers:

1. Black-Scholes and derivatives pricing fundamentals
2. Monte Carlo simulations
3. Binomial trees
4. Trinomial trees
5. Finite-difference methods
6. Exotic options
7. Stochastic volatility
8. Statistical models
9. Stochastic multi-factor models
10. Single-factor interest rate models
11. Tree-building procedures
12. Two-factor models and the HJM model
13. LIBOR market models
14. Bermudan and exotic interest rate derivatives 

Each chapter contains:

1. Python code
2. Brief notes that accompany, and allow for minimal reproducibility of the Python code written.
